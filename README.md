[PlanetaryXR](http://planetaryxr.netlify.app/) is an augmented reality (AR) / virtual reality (VR) web app featuring 3D models of planetary bodies, built using [A-Frame](https://a-frame.io/), [ARToolKit](https://artoolkit.org/) and the [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js) library. It is currently in the process of being ported to native [Three.js](https://threejs.org).

AR markers can be downloaded [here](./markers-v0.1.5.pdf).

Although primarily focused on creating an AR experience, PlanetaryXR also features a virtual reality (VR) mode which will build upon the 3D planetary models by offering a locational data and a lightweight map interface.

Both AR and VR apps are currently in very early development.
